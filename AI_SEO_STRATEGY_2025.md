#### Testing Process

1. **Copy page content** (just the text)
2. **Submit to ChatGPT/Perplexity** with prompt:
   ```
   Summarize this travel page and identify the key information 
   a traveler needs to know:
   [paste content]
   ```
3. **Check if AI captures:**
   - Main value proposition

   - Call-to-action

4. **If AI misses key points:**
   - Rewrite content for clarity

   - Front-load important information
   - Remove fluff and filler

#### Content Clarity Checklist

For each page, ensure:

- [ ] **Clear CTA** in first 200 words

- [ ] **Short paragraphs** (3-4 sentences max)

unforgettable journeys for discerning travelers who appreciate 
the finer things in life. Our team of passionate experts will 
guide you through this island paradise...

**AI Summary:** "A Sri Lanka travel company that offers tours."
(Missing: specific tours, prices, differentiators)
