# Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

Your code is committed and ready to push! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `recharge-travels-admin` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Recharge Travels Admin Panel - Working version with fixed React contexts"
4. Choose: **Private** (recommended for admin panel)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/nanthan/Desktop/Recharge Travles new -rep-10-10-25/rechargetravels-sri-lankashalli-create-in-github-main"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Or if using SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository to confirm all files are there.

## Need Help?

If you get errors while pushing:

### Authentication Error
```bash
# Use personal access token instead of password
# Generate one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

### Already Exists Error
```bash
# If repository already has content, use:
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Branch Name Different
```bash
# If GitHub uses 'master' instead of 'main':
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
