## Sample Posts (Copy & Modify)

### Post 1: Detailed Itinerary

**Title:** `Just finished planning 12 days in Sri Lanka - here's my itinerary (feedback welcome!)`

**Body:**
```
Hi everyone! After weeks of research (mostly on this sub - thank you!), 
I've finalized my itinerary. Would love feedback from those who've been.

**Travel Style:** Couple, mid-budget, interested in culture + wildlife + beaches

**Dates:** February (supposedly perfect weather for south/west)

**The Plan:**

Day 1-2: Negombo
- Arrive CMB, 15 min to hotel
- Recover, explore fish market, Dutch canal
- Hotel: [mid-range option]

Day 3-4: Sigiriya Area  
- Drive to Cultural Triangle (4 hrs)
- Day 3: Sigiriya Rock (early morning to avoid heat)
- Day 4: Dambulla caves + village tour
- Staying in Habarana area

Day 5-6: Kandy
- Temple of the Tooth (evening ceremony)
- Botanical gardens
- Possible cooking class
- Taking train to Ella next

Day 7-8: Ella
- THE TRAIN! Booked observation class.
- Nine Arch Bridge at sunrise
- Little Adam's Peak hike
- Ravana Falls

Day 9-10: Yala Safari
- Two safaris (AM + PM)
- Hoping for leopards!
- Staying just outside park

Day 11-12: Mirissa/Galle
- Whale watching (booked for Day 11, 6am)
- Galle Fort afternoon
- Beach relaxation
- Last night in Galle

Day 13: Fly out from Colombo

**Questions:**
1. Is 2 nights in Ella enough?
2. Any must-do restaurants?
3. Should I pre-book safaris or arrange locally?

Thanks in advance! 🙏
```

### Post 2: Answering Common Questions

**When you see:** "Is hiring a driver worth it in Sri Lanka?"

**Reply:**
```
100% worth it, especially for first-timers. Here's why:

**Pros:**
- Roads are challenging (narrow, left-side driving, chaotic)
- Drivers know the best routes and hidden spots
- They often speak English and share local knowledge
- Wait while you explore, very flexible
- Cost is surprisingly reasonable

**Cost:** Around $60-100/day for car + driver, depending on 
vehicle type and whether fuel is included. For a 10-day trip, 
we paid about $700 total.

**Tips for hiring:**
1. Ask your accommodation - they usually have trusted contacts
2. Agree on price, fuel, and what's included upfront
3. Driver's meals and accommodation are traditionally covered 
   (budget extra $10-15/day)
4. Tip at the end if service was good ($5-10/day is generous)

**Alternative:** For shorter trips or single destinations, 
you can also use PickMe (like Uber) which works well in cities.

### Post 3: Safari Comparison

**Title:** `Yala vs Udawalawe vs Wilpattu - which Sri Lanka safari should you choose?`

**Body:**
```
After doing safaris in all three parks over multiple trips, 
here's my honest breakdown:

## Yala National Park 🐆

**Best for:** Leopards (highest density in the world)
**Downside:** Crowded, especially in peak season
**When:** February-July (avoid Sept-Oct closure)
**Cost:** ~$100-150/person for half-day

*My experience:* Saw 3 leopards on one safari, but there were 
20+ jeeps around. Still amazing though.

## Udawalawe National Park 🐘

**Best for:** Elephants (500+ resident, guaranteed sightings)
**Downside:** Fewer diverse species than Yala
**When:** Year-round (no closure)
**Cost:** ~$80-120/person

*My experience:* Saw 40+ elephants, including babies. Less 
crowded, more intimate. My top recommendation for families.

## Wilpattu National Park 🦌

**Best for:** Leopards + solitude (largest park, fewest tourists)
**Downside:** Animals harder to spot (more vegetation)
**When:** February-October
**Cost:** ~$100-150/person

*My experience:* Only 3 other jeeps the whole time. Saw sloth 
bear, which was incredible. Felt like a real wilderness experience.

## My recommendation:

- **First-timer + want leopards:** Yala
- **Families + want elephants:** Udawalawe
- **Repeat visitor + hate crowds:** Wilpattu
- **Have time:** Do 2 parks!

Happy to answer specific questions!
