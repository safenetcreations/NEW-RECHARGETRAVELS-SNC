# Best Time to Visit Sri Lanka: Complete Month-by-Month Guide 2025

Planning a trip to Sri Lanka but confused about when to visit? You're not alone! Sri Lanka's tropical climate means it's a year-round destination, but choosing the right time can make or break your experience.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down the best time to visit Sri Lanka month by month, covering weather patterns, festivals, crowd levels, and prices to help you plan the perfect trip.
