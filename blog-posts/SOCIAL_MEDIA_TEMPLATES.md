🌴 WHEN SHOULD YOU VISIT SRI LANKA? ☀️

This is THE most common question we get!

The answer? It depends on what you want to do! 🤔

Sri Lanka has 2 MONSOON seasons - which means some part of the island has PERFECT weather year-round! 🌈

📅 OUR MONTH-BY-MONTH BREAKDOWN:

✨ DEC-MAR: Best overall (west/south beaches, culture, wildlife)
🏄 MAY-SEP: Perfect for east coast (Arugam Bay!)
🐘 JUL-AUG: The Gathering (300+ elephants!)
🐋 DEC-MAR: Whale watching season
🌧️ OCT: Wettest month (but great prices!)

💡 CRAZY FACT: One coast can be sunny while the other is rainy! That's why Sri Lanka is a year-round destination!

🌴 WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT SRI LANKA? ☀️

Planning your Sri Lankan adventure but confused about the weather? You're not alone!

Here's the thing: Sri Lanka doesn't have 4 seasons like most countries. Instead, it has TWO MONSOON SEASONS that affect different parts of the island at different times.

📅 QUICK ANSWER:

🏆 BEST OVERALL: December - March
Perfect for beaches (west/south), culture, safaris, whale watching

🥈 RUNNER-UP: July - September  
Ideal for east coast beaches (Arugam Bay), surfing, fewer crowds

BUT... the "best" time really depends on YOUR interests!

Our brand new guide covers:

✅ Month-by-month weather breakdown
✅ When to visit each region (beaches, hills, culture)
✅ Festival calendar for 2025
✅ Crowd levels & price ranges
✅ What to pack for each season
✅ Best time for specific activities (surfing, wildlife, diving)

📌 INTERESTING FACTS:

• West coast beaches are best Dec-Apr
• East coast beaches are best May-Sep  
• You can surf year-round (just different coasts!)
• The busiest month is January
• The cheapest month is October
• Whale watching: Dec-Mar in Mirissa
