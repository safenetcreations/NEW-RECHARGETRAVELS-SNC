# Custom Domain Deployment - www.rechargetravels.com

## 🌐 Live URLs

Your website is now deployed and accessible at:

- **Custom Domain**: https://www.rechargetravels.com
- **Firebase Default**: https://recharge-travels-73e76.web.app
- **Admin Panel**: https://recharge-travels-admin.web.app

## ✅ Deployment Status

The latest deployment includes:
- ✨ Redesigned premium footer with smooth animations
- 🎨 Glass morphism effects and gradient backgrounds
- 📱 All existing functionality preserved
- 🚀 Performance optimizations

## 🔄 How Custom Domain Works

1. **DNS Configuration** (Already done in Firebase Console)
   - A record pointing to Firebase hosting IP
   - SSL certificate automatically provisioned by Firebase

2. **Automatic Routing**
   - When you deploy to Firebase, content is automatically served on:
     - www.rechargetravels.com (custom domain)
     - recharge-travels-73e76.web.app (Firebase domain)

3. **SSL/HTTPS**
   - Firebase automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates
   - All traffic is secured with HTTPS

## 📋 Deployment Commands

Deploy updates to your custom domain:

```bash
# Deploy everything (main site + admin)
npm run deploy:all

# Deploy main site only
npm run deploy:main

# Deploy admin panel only
npm run deploy:admin

# Using the deployment script
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
```

## 🔍 Verifying Deployment

1. **Check Custom Domain**
   - Visit https://www.rechargetravels.com
   - Verify the site loads with latest changes

2. **Check SSL Certificate**
   - Look for the padlock icon in browser
   - Certificate should be issued by Google Trust Services

3. **Check Admin Panel**
   - Visit https://recharge-travels-admin.web.app
   - Login with credentials: nanthan77@gmail.com / recharge2024admin

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Domain Not Loading
- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
- Clear browser cache
- Try accessing from different device/network

### SSL Certificate Issues
- Firebase automatically handles SSL
- If issues persist, check Firebase Console > Hosting > Custom domains

### Content Not Updating
```bash
# Clear cache and redeploy
rm -rf dist admin/dist
npm run deploy:all
```

## 📊 Monitoring

1. **Firebase Console**
   - View hosting status: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/recharge-travels-73e76/hosting
   - Check domain verification status
   - Monitor usage and performance

2. **GitHub Actions**
   - Automatic deployments on push to main branch
   - Check status: https://github.com/nanthan77/rechargetravels-sri-lankashalli-create-in-github/actions

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up redirects** (optional)
   - Redirect non-www to www
   - Redirect old URLs to new structure

2. **Configure CDN** (optional)
   - Firebase hosting includes global CDN
   - Additional configuration available in firebase.json

3. **Set up monitoring**
   - Google Analytics (already configured)
   - Uptime monitoring
   - Performance tracking

## 📝 Important Notes

- Always test locally before deploying
- Keep firebase.json in sync with domain configuration
- Custom domain serves the same content as Firebase domain
- Admin panel remains on separate subdomain for security
