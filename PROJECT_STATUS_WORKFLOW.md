2. Visit live sites
3. Test new features
4. Check browser console for errors

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Build shows warnings but completes successfully
2. **Bundle Size**: Main chunk is large (1.7MB), needs optimization
3. **Firebase Auth**: Using hardcoded auth instead of Firebase Auth
4. **Font Loading**: Some font files show warnings during build

## 📝 Development Guidelines

- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript types properly
- No comments unless explicitly needed

### Git Workflow
