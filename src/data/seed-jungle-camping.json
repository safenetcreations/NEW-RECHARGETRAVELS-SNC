Sri Lanka's rain‑forests shelter world‑record biodiversity—endemic birds, purple‑faced langurs and fragrant lianas twisting skyward. Recharge Travels' Jungle Camping packages pitch you deep inside Sinharaja, Knuckles and Wasgamuwa buffer zones with leave‑no‑trace camps, chef‑prepared meals and naturalist guides. By day, trace leopard tracks to secret waterfalls; by night, scan treetops for luminous lichen and firefly constellations. Safety, comfort and raw wilderness—no compromise.",
