  "introParagraph": "Once a sleepy fishing village, Hikkaduwa has evolved into Sri Lanka's water‑sports capital—where gentle reef breaks greet first‑time surfers, technicolour coral gardens lure snorkellers and adrenaline junkies rev their jet‑skis across turquoise swells. With Recharge Travels you'll paddle out with ISA‑certified instructors, glide above sea‑turtle sanctuaries and toast sunset on a stand‑up paddle board safari. All gear, insurance and hotel transfers are handled by our crew, leaving you free to chase the perfect splash from dawn till dusk.",
