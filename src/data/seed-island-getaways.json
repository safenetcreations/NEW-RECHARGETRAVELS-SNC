  "introParagraph": "Just beyond Sri Lanka's northern coast lies an archipelago of untamed coral islets where feral ponies graze, Portuguese forts crumble and sandbanks glow silver beneath the Indian Ocean sun. Our Island Getaways whisk you across turquoise channels to Delft, Kayts, Mannar and more—pairing rustic charm with plush logistics. Speedboat transfers, beach BBQs and insider guides reveal stories of Chola kings, Dutch traders and Tamil fishing clans while keeping your toes buried in powder‑soft sand. Whether you crave shipwreck snorkels or flamingo‑filled lagoons, Recharge Travels turns the map's outer edges into your private playground.",
