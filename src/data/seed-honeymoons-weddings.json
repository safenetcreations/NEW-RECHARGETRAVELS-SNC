  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Can foreigners legally get married in Sri Lanka?",
      "a": "Yes. We handle affidavits, passport copies, birth certificates and registrar coordination. Plan for ~4 working days lead time for legal formalities."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is the elephant blessing ethical?",
      "a": "We only partner with vetted sanctuaries that meet welfare standards. If you prefer, we provide cultural alternatives—Kandyan drummers, vintage cars, horse carriages."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the best month for a beach wedding?",
      "a": "Nov–Apr (south/west coasts) & May–Sep (east coast: Trincomalee, Passikudah) for the most reliable weather windows."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's included in a typical honeymoon package?",
      "a": "Private driver-guide, selected boutique stays, activities (Sigiriya, tea trails, safaris), breakfasts or half-board, and 24/7 concierge."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we customise every detail?",
      "a": "Absolutely—menus, décor palettes, guest logistics, cultural ceremonies, transport, and post-wedding trips are all tailor-made."
    },
    {
      "q": "How early should we secure a date and venue?",
      "a": "Begin at least 9–12 months ahead so every legal formality, décor detail and guest room is locked-in long before your big day."
    },
    {
      "q": "What sustainability options do you offer?",
      "a": "Choose local, organic flowers, plastic-free décor, reef-safe confetti and give-back add-ons like tree-planting or community donations to keep your celebration planet-positive."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is a destination wedding really cost-effective?",
      "a": "With slimmer guest lists and bundled venue deals, couples often spend less than on a large hometown event—while upgrading the overall experience."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we combine our wedding and honeymoon?",
      "a": "Yes—many couples roll straight into a tea-country mini-moon or beach retreat, turning one trip into a seamless celebration and escape."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you arrange guest activities beyond the big day?",
      "a": "Yes—think lagoon cruises, wildlife safaris, cultural parades or spa days so guests enjoy a full holiday experience."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we include beauty and wellness treatments?",
      "a": "Absolutely—bridal hair & makeup, spa rituals and pre-wedding wellness packages can be integrated for you and your party."
    },
    {
      "q": "How is local culture woven into ceremonies?",
      "a": "Options range from Kandyan drummers and dancers to Hindu blessings, Sri Maha Bodhi sapling plantings and regional menus that honour local heritage."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why do modern couples choose destination weddings?",
      "a": "They crave unique settings, intimate guest lists, cost efficiency and the freedom to merge wedding and honeymoon into one epic trip."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do you handle safety, security and accessibility?",
      "a": "We vet venues for 24-hour security, wheelchair-friendly layouts and emergency medical plans so every guest feels comfortable and safe."
    },
    {
      "q": "What guest-service extras are available?",
