  "introParagraph": "From crackling mustard seeds to the earthy perfume of roasted curry powder, Sri Lankan cuisine is a feast for all senses. Our hands‑on cooking classes start at the root—literally—wandering bustling spice markets and organic village gardens before you step behind the hearth with an auntie‑chef. Pound pol sambol on a granite mortar, scrape fresh coconut with a kiri hodi, simmer ambul thiyal in a clay pot, then sit down to taste the flavours you created. With Recharge Travels you'll carry home more than recipes; you'll carry the rhythm of island hospitality.",
