  "introParagraph": "From the golden spire of Kandy's Temple of the Tooth to the windswept summit of Adam's Peak, Sri Lanka is a crossroads of sacred traditions stretching back 2,300 years. Our Pilgrimage Tours trace those holy footprints—linking Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim shrines in a seamless journey of faith. Guided by local custodians, you'll meditate beneath the 2,300‑year‑old Sri Maha Bodhi, join torch‑lit devotees ascending Sri Pada at midnight, and experience the vibrant inter‑faith rituals of Kataragama. Each step is cushioned by Recharge Travels comfort: private transport, heritage hotels near the shrines, and round‑the‑clock support for body and soul alike.",
