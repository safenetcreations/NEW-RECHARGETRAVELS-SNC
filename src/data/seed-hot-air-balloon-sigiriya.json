  "introParagraph": "Nothing prepares you for the hush that falls when the burner quiets and your balloon drifts weightless over Sri Lanka's Cultural Triangle. Below, the Lion Rock of Sigiriya pierces morning mist; to the west, the stupas of Dambulla glint gold; and in every direction, jungle and paddies glow emerald under the rising sun. With Recharge Travels, you're in safe hands—Civil Aviation‑licensed pilots, GPS‑tracked chase crew, champagne breakfast on landing and seamless hotel transfers mean your only task is to soak up 360‑degree serenity from 1,500 feet in the air.",
