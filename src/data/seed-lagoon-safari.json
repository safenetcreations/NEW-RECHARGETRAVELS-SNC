  "introParagraph": "Away from the surf‚Äëlashed coast, Sri Lanka's lagoons whisper with bird‚Äësong, cinnamon aromas and the quiet dip of a paddle. Recharge Travels' Lagoon Safaris steer you into this hidden water‚Äëworld‚Äîwhere knitted mangrove roots create secret tunnels and stilt fishermen still cast by moonlight. Drift past floating cinnamon workshops, watch brahminy kites dive for mullet, feel doctor fish nibble your feet and, if luck strikes, glimpse a mugger crocodile sliding off a muddy bank. With licensed boatmen, life‚Äëjackets, insurance and naturalist guides, we turn a simple cruise into a living lesson in coastal ecology and culture.",
