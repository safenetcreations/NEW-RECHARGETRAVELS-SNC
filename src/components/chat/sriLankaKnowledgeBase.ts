Sri Lankan Transport System & Recharge Travels - Comprehensive Travel FAQ

General Questions about Transportation in Sri Lanka

Q: Is it easy to travel around Sri Lanka as a tourist?
A: Yes - getting around Sri Lanka is generally straightforward for tourists. The country offers a variety of transport options from public buses and scenic trains to private taxis and car hires. English is widely spoken in tourist areas and signage on major roads and stations is often in English, making navigation easier. While travel can be time-consuming due to road conditions and traffic, the diversity of transport modes ensures you can reach almost any destination with a bit of planning.

Q: Which modes of transport are commonly used in Sri Lanka?
A: Sri Lanka's transport network includes buses, trains, tuk-tuks (three-wheeler rickshaws), taxis, and even domestic flights for certain routes. Buses and tuk-tuks are the most ubiquitous local transport modes - buses for both short hops and intercity travel, and tuk-tuks for quick trips around towns. Trains connect many major cities and offer scenic journeys, especially in the hill country. For more convenience, travelers use private cars or vans with drivers (such as services provided by Recharge Travels) or ride-hailing taxis via apps.

Q: Do I need a visa to visit Sri Lanka?
A: Most visitors need a visa to enter Sri Lanka. You can apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) online before arrival. The ETA is valid for 30 days and can be extended. Some nationalities may get visa on arrival, but it's recommended to get the ETA in advance to avoid delays. The process is straightforward - visit the official ETA website, fill the form, pay the fee (around $35-50), and receive approval via email usually within 24 hours.

Q: What is the best time to visit Sri Lanka?
A: Sri Lanka can be visited year-round as different regions have different weather patterns. The west and south coasts (including Colombo, Galle, and beach areas) are best from December to March when it's dry. The east coast (Trincomalee, Arugam Bay) is ideal from April to September. The cultural triangle and hill country are pleasant throughout the year, though December to March tends to be drier. Avoid the southwest monsoon (May to August) for west coast beaches and northeast monsoon (October to January) for east coast areas.

Q: What currency is used in Sri Lanka?
A: The Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) is the official currency. US dollars are widely accepted at hotels and tourist establishments, but you'll need rupees for local transport, restaurants, and shops. ATMs are widely available in cities and towns, accepting international cards. Exchange money at banks, official exchange counters, or authorized dealers for better rates. Avoid exchanging money with street dealers. Credit cards are accepted at major hotels, restaurants, and shops in tourist areas.

Q: Is Sri Lanka safe for tourists?
A: Yes, Sri Lanka is generally very safe for tourists. The country has been peaceful since 2009, and tourism is welcomed. As with any destination, use common sense - don't flash valuables, be aware of your surroundings, and avoid isolated areas at night. The biggest risks are usually traffic-related rather than crime-related. Solo female travelers regularly visit without issues, though modest dress is recommended, especially at religious sites. Always use registered tour operators and licensed guides for activities.

Q: What should I pack for Sri Lanka?
A: Pack light, breathable clothing as Sri Lanka is tropical and humid. Essentials include: lightweight cotton clothes, comfortable walking shoes, sandals, sunscreen (high SPF), insect repellent, hat, sunglasses, rain jacket or umbrella, modest clothing for temples (covering shoulders and knees), swimwear for beaches, and any prescription medications. If visiting the hill country, bring a light jacket as it can be cool. A small daypack is useful for excursions.

Q: What about food and water safety?
A: Tap water is not recommended for drinking - stick to bottled water which is cheap and widely available. Ice in tourist restaurants is generally safe as they use purified water. Sri Lankan cuisine is delicious but can be spicy. Start mild and build up tolerance. Eat at busy restaurants with good turnover. Avoid raw vegetables and pre-cut fruit from street vendors. Most tourists have no issues, but bring anti-diarrheal medication just in case. Vegetarian and vegan options are plentiful.

Q: Do I need any vaccinations for Sri Lanka?
A: No vaccinations are mandatory for Sri Lanka unless arriving from a yellow fever area. However, recommended vaccinations include Hepatitis A and B, Typhoid, and routine vaccinations (MMR, DPT, flu). Malaria risk is very low except in certain northern areas. Dengue fever, transmitted by daytime mosquitoes, is more common - use insect repellent. Consult a travel doctor 4-6 weeks before travel for personalized advice.

Q: What are the must-see attractions in Sri Lanka?
A: Key attractions include: Sigiriya Rock Fortress (ancient palace atop a rock), Temple of the Tooth in Kandy (Buddhist temple), Galle Fort (colonial fortified city), Yala National Park (wildlife including leopards), Ella (scenic hill country with trains), beaches of the south coast (Mirissa, Unawatuna), ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, tea plantations around Nuwara Eliya, and whale watching in Mirissa (November to April).

Transportation FAQs

Q: How do I get from Colombo Airport to the city?
A: Several options exist: Official airport taxi (counter in arrivals, fixed prices), ride-hailing apps like PickMe or Uber, airport bus (Route 187 to Colombo Fort, very cheap), or pre-arranged transfer through hotels or companies like Recharge Travels. The airport is about 35km from Colombo city center, taking 45 minutes to 1.5 hours depending on traffic. Costs range from $0.50 (bus) to $20-30 (taxi).

Q: Should I hire a driver or self-drive in Sri Lanka?
A: Most tourists prefer hiring a driver for several reasons: local drivers know the roads, traffic can be chaotic for those used to Western driving, road signs may be in Sinhala/Tamil, and parking in cities is challenging. A car with driver typically costs $40-60 per day including fuel. Self-driving requires an international driving permit and temporary local permit. If you do self-drive, be extra cautious and avoid night driving.

Q: What's the best way to travel between cities?
A: It depends on your priorities. Trains offer scenic journeys, especially Kandy to Ella route, and are very cheap but can be slow and crowded. Buses are the cheapest option with extensive networks but can be uncomfortable for long journeys. Private car/van with driver offers comfort, flexibility, and door-to-door service - ideal for families or groups. Domestic flights exist but are expensive and limited. Many tourists use a combination based on their itinerary.

Q: How do tuk-tuks work and what should they cost?
A: Tuk-tuks (three-wheelers) are everywhere and great for short distances. Always agree on price before starting or ensure the meter is used. In Colombo, metered tuk-tuks charge around LKR 50-70 per km. For non-metered, expect LKR 100-150 per km in tourist areas. Use ride-hailing apps like PickMe for transparent pricing. For safety, avoid tuk-tuks late at night and don't accept tours or shopping trips from tuk-tuk drivers (often commission-based scams).

Q: Can I book train tickets in advance?
A: Yes, for reserved seats/berths on intercity trains. First-class observation carriages and second-class reserved seats can be booked up to 30 days in advance at major stations or online through websites like railway.gov.lk or 12go.asia. Unreserved second and third-class tickets are sold on the day of travel only. Popular tourist routes like Kandy-Ella should be booked early, especially the observation car. Many tourists find the crowded local experience in unreserved carriages part of the adventure.

Q: What are the scenic train routes?
A: The most famous is Kandy to Ella (or extending to Badulla), passing through tea plantations, mountains, and the famous Nine Arch Bridge. The route from Colombo to Kandy is also scenic in parts. The coastal line from Colombo to Galle hugs the ocean and is beautiful. For the best views on the hill country trains, try to get seats on the right side when traveling from Kandy to Ella.

Q: Are there express highways in Sri Lanka?
A: Yes, Sri Lanka has several modern expressways (E-class roads) with tolls. The Southern Expressway (E01) connects Colombo to Galle/Matara, drastically reducing travel time. The Outer Circular Highway (E02) bypasses Colombo. The Central Expressway (E04) connects to the center of the country. These are the fastest routes but tolls apply (typically LKR 400-600 for cars). Only certain entry/exit points exist, so plan accordingly.

Q: How reliable are buses for tourists?
A: Public buses are very reliable in terms of coverage - they go almost everywhere. However, they can be crowded, hot (many lack AC), and drivers sometimes drive aggressively. Express buses and private AC buses offer more comfort. For tourists, buses work well for shorter journeys or if you're budget-conscious. Keep belongings secure and be prepared for a local experience. Tourist-oriented private buses are available for popular routes.

About Recharge Travels

Q: What services does Recharge Travels offer?
A: Recharge Travels specializes in private transportation throughout Sri Lanka. Services include airport transfers, day tours, multi-day tours with driver-guides, customized itineraries, and vehicle rentals with drivers. The company offers various vehicle types from cars to vans and buses for different group sizes. All drivers are experienced, English-speaking, and knowledgeable about tourist destinations.

Q: How do I book with Recharge Travels?
A: Booking can be done through their website, by email, phone, or WhatsApp. It's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak season (December to March). Provide your travel dates, number of passengers, and intended destinations. You'll receive a quote and can customize the itinerary. Payment terms are usually a deposit upon booking with balance paid to the driver or before the tour starts.

Q: What types of vehicles does Recharge Travels provide?
A: The fleet includes: small cars for 1-3 passengers (like Toyota Prius), larger cars for 3-4 passengers, mini-vans for 4-6 passengers, larger vans for 6-8 passengers, and mini-buses for bigger groups. All vehicles are air-conditioned, well-maintained, and come with experienced drivers. Child seats can be arranged upon request.

Q: Are Recharge Travels drivers also guides?
A: Many drivers have extensive knowledge about Sri Lanka and can provide basic guiding services, sharing information about places you visit. However, for detailed historical/cultural information at sites like ancient cities, you may want to hire specialist local guides (which can be arranged). Drivers are perfect for general travel advice, restaurant recommendations, and practical tips.

Q: What's included in Recharge Travels' tour prices?
A: Typically included: vehicle, driver, fuel, driver's accommodation and meals, parking fees, and highway tolls. Not included: entrance fees to attractions, your accommodation and meals, tips for driver, and any activities. This can be customized - some packages include accommodations and activities. Always clarify inclusions when booking.

Q: Can Recharge Travels arrange accommodation?
A: Yes, they can recommend and book accommodations based on your budget and preferences. They work with a network of hotels, guesthouses, and boutique properties across Sri Lanka. This can be convenient as drivers know the locations and can ensure smooth check-ins. However, you're also free to book your own accommodation and just use transport services.

Q: Is it cheaper to use public transport or Recharge Travels?
A: Public transport is definitely cheaper - a bus ride might cost $1 while a private car for the same route could be $50. However, Recharge Travels offers value through comfort, time-saving, door-to-door service, flexibility to stop anywhere, local knowledge, and safety. For families or groups, the per-person cost becomes more reasonable. Many tourists use a mix - private transport for longer journeys or when carrying luggage, and public transport for short trips or experiences.

Q: What about tipping Recharge Travels drivers?
A: Tipping is not mandatory but appreciated. A general guideline is $5-10 per day for good service, more if the driver goes above and beyond. Some tourists prefer to give a lump sum at the end of a multi-day tour. Drivers often help with luggage, provide local insights, and may assist with negotiations at shops or attractions, so tipping acknowledges this extra service.

Q: Can I modify my itinerary during the tour?
A: Yes, one advantage of private transport is flexibility. Drivers are usually accommodating about route changes, additional stops, or spending more/less time at locations. However, major changes affecting distance or days should be discussed as they may affect pricing. Communicate openly with your driver about preferences - they want you to have the best experience.

Q: How far in advance should I book with Recharge Travels?
A: For peak season (December to March), book at least 2-4 weeks ahead to ensure availability. For off-season, 1-2 weeks is usually sufficient. Last-minute bookings may be possible but with limited vehicle choice. Airport transfers can often be arranged with just a few days' notice. The earlier you book, the better chance of getting your preferred vehicle type and potentially better rates.

Special Interests

Q: What are the best beaches in Sri Lanka?
A: South Coast: Mirissa (whale watching, relaxed vibe), Unawatuna (swimming, restaurants), Tangalle (quieter, long beaches), Weligama (surfing, stilt fishermen). West Coast: Bentota (water sports, resorts), Hikkaduwa (snorkeling, party scene). East Coast: Arugam Bay (surfing mecca), Pasikuda (shallow calm waters), Nilaveli (pristine and quiet). Beach choice depends on season - west/south for December-March, east for April-September.

Q: Where can I see elephants in Sri Lanka?
A: Udawalawe National Park is best for elephant sightings with herds in open grasslands. Minneriya National Park hosts "The Gathering" (July-September) where hundreds of elephants congregate. Yala National Park also has elephants plus leopards. Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage is touristy but allows close encounters. Wild elephants can sometimes be seen in rural areas but maintain safe distance. Ethical elephant experiences avoid riding or direct contact.

Q: What about whale watching?
A: Mirissa is the main whale watching hub (November to April) with blue whales, sperm whales, and dolphins. Trincomalee offers whale watching on the east coast (March to August). Tours leave early morning and last 3-5 hours. Success rates are high but sightings aren't guaranteed. Choose responsible operators who maintain distance from whales. Rough seas can cause seasickness - take medication if prone.

Q: Can I see leopards in Sri Lanka?
A: Yala National Park has one of the world's highest leopard densities, making sightings possible but not guaranteed. Block 1 of Yala is best for leopards. Wilpattu National Park also has leopards in a less crowded setting. Best times are early morning and late afternoon. Dry season (February to July) offers better visibility. Book safaris with experienced drivers who know leopard territories. Remember wildlife sightings depend on luck.

Q: What cultural sites should I not miss?
A: Sigiriya (5th-century rock fortress with frescoes), Temple of the Tooth Kandy (Buddhism's most sacred site in Sri Lanka), Dambulla Cave Temple (ancient cave paintings and statues), Anuradhapura (ancient capital with stupas and bo tree), Polonnaruwa (medieval capital with well-preserved ruins), Galle Fort (colonial architecture and ramparts). Most sites require modest dress and removing shoes. Hire local guides for historical context.

Q: Where are the best places for surfing?
A: Arugam Bay is Sri Lanka's surfing capital (April to October) with consistent waves for all levels. South coast spots include Weligama Bay (great for beginners), Mirissa (intermediate), and Hikkaduwa (year-round but best November to April). West coast Kalpitiya is emerging for kitesurfing. Surf schools, board rentals, and accommodation are readily available at all major spots. Respect local surfers and beach etiquette.

Q: What's special about Sri Lankan tea?
A: Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) produces some of the world's finest tea. Visit tea plantations around Nuwara Eliya, Ella, and Haputale. Many estates offer tours showing picking, processing, and tasting. The Tea Factory Hotel and Heritance Tea Factory are hotels converted from factories. Take the train through tea country for spectacular views. Buy tea directly from factories for best quality and prices. Each region produces different flavors due to elevation.

Q: Are there any festivals I should plan around?
A: Major festivals include: Sinhala/Tamil New Year (April 13-14), Vesak (May full moon) celebrating Buddha's birth/enlightenment, Kandy Esala Perahera (July/August) with elephant processions, Deepavali (October/November) Hindu festival of lights. During festivals, expect closures, crowded transport, and accommodation shortages but also vibrant celebrations. The Kandy Perahera is spectacular but book accommodation months ahead.

Practical Tips

Q: What about photography in Sri Lanka?
A: Sri Lanka is very photogenic but be respectful. Always ask before photographing people, especially in rural areas. Photography is prohibited at certain religious sites or requires a fee. Never photograph military installations, personnel, or government buildings. Drone usage requires permits from Civil Aviation Authority. Temple photography usually forbids flash and posing with Buddha statues. Early morning and late afternoon provide best light and cooler temperatures.

Q: How do I handle money and bargaining?
A: ATMs are widely available in cities and towns. Inform your bank of travel plans. Keep some small bills for tips, tuk-tuks, and small purchases. Bargaining is expected at markets, with tuk-tuks, and some shops but not in supermarkets or restaurants. Start at 50-60% of asking price at tourist markets. Be fair - a dollar means more to locals. Many places now accept cards but cash is still king, especially outside cities.

Q: What if I get sick in Sri Lanka?
A: Private hospitals in Colombo like Asiri or Nawaloka offer good care with English-speaking staff. Most towns have private clinics for minor issues. Pharmacies are plentiful and many medications are available without prescription. Travel insurance is essential for medical evacuation if needed. Common issues are stomach upsets (usually mild) and mosquito bites. Dengue fever is the main health concern - use repellent and seek medical attention for high fever.

Q: How connected is Sri Lanka (internet/phone)?
A: Sri Lanka has good connectivity. Buy a local SIM card at the airport or shops - Dialog and Mobitel are main providers. Tourist packages offer data at reasonable rates. 4G coverage is good in cities and towns, variable in rural areas. WiFi is standard in hotels and many restaurants. Power outages occasionally occur but most hotels have generators. Electrical plugs are Type D and G (British style) - bring adapters.

Q: Can I smoke in Sri Lanka? What are the smoking regulations?
A: Smoking is legal in Sri Lanka but restricted in many public places. You cannot smoke in: government buildings, public transport, hospitals, schools, religious sites, enclosed public spaces, restaurants with AC, and some beaches. Smoking is generally allowed: in designated smoking areas, open-air spaces, your hotel room balcony (check hotel policy), and most outdoor areas. Cigarettes are widely available at shops. Be respectful - avoid smoking near temples, children, or in crowded areas. Some hotels are entirely smoke-free, so check before booking. Fines apply for smoking in prohibited areas.

Q: What shouldn't I do in Sri Lanka?
A: Don't: touch or turn your back on Buddha statues, wear revealing clothes at religious sites, use your left hand for eating or giving things, point feet at people or religious objects, display public affection, photograph without permission, buy or use drugs (penalties are severe), remove coral or shells from beaches, feed wild animals. Do: dress modestly, remove shoes at temples, be patient with slower pace, respect local customs.

Q: Is Sri Lanka good for solo female travelers?
A: Yes, many women travel solo in Sri Lanka safely. Dress modestly (covering shoulders and knees) to avoid unwanted attention. Use registered accommodations and transport. Avoid isolated beaches or areas after dark. Sit near families on public transport. Some may experience staring or comments but serious harassment is rare. Trust your instincts. Join group tours for activities if feeling unsafe. Many guesthouses are family-run providing secure environments.

Q: What's the food like for vegetarians/vegans?
A: Sri Lanka is excellent for vegetarians/vegans. Rice and curry meals always include vegetable curries, dhal, and sambols. Many Buddhist restaurants are purely vegetarian. South Indian restaurants offer dosas, idli, and vegetarian thalis. Fruit is abundant and delicious. Inform restaurants about dietary requirements - "no meat, fish, or eggs" is understood. Be aware some curry preparations may use fish-based ingredients so specify if strict vegan. Western-style vegetarian food is available in tourist areas.

Q: How much should I budget per day?
A: Budget varies greatly: Backpacker: $20-30/day (local transport, guesthouses, local food). Mid-range: $50-100/day (AC rooms, some private transport, mix of restaurants). Luxury: $150+/day (boutique hotels, private transport, fine dining). Major costs: accommodation ($10-200+/night), transport (public cheap, private varies), food ($2-20/meal), entrance fees ($10-30 for major sites), activities (whale watching $40, safari $50). Book accommodation and transport in advance during peak season for better rates.

Q: What souvenirs should I buy?
A: Popular souvenirs: Ceylon tea (buy from estates), spices (cinnamon, cardamom, pepper), gems (only from reputable dealers with certificates), batik and handloom textiles, wooden masks (traditional devil masks), elephant-themed crafts (ensure ethically made), Ayurvedic products, cashews. Avoid: coral, shells, turtle shell products, ivory (all illegal). Laksala government shops have fixed prices and quality guarantees. Negotiate at markets but pay fair prices for handmade items.

Q: Can I use credit cards widely?
A: Credit cards (Visa, MasterCard) are accepted at hotels, upscale restaurants, shopping malls, and tourist shops in cities. However, smaller establishments, local restaurants, transport, and rural areas operate on cash only. Always carry sufficient cash. Some places add 3-4% surcharge for card payments. ATMs are reliable in cities - withdraw larger amounts to minimize fees. Notify your bank of travel to avoid card blocks.

Emergency and Safety

Q: What are emergency numbers in Sri Lanka?
A: Police: 119, Tourist Police: 1912, Fire & Ambulance: 110, Emergency Hospital: 1990. Save these in your phone. Tourist Police speak English and assist with tourist-related issues. For medical emergencies in Colombo, private hospitals like Asiri (011-4523300) respond faster than government hospitals. Your hotel or driver can also assist in emergencies.

Q: Is tap water safe to drink?
A: Generally no - stick to bottled water which costs around LKR 50-100 per liter. Most hotels provide complimentary bottled water. Avoid ice from street vendors but restaurant ice is usually filtered. Brush teeth with bottled water if you have a sensitive stomach. Boiled water and hot beverages are safe. Consider bringing water purification tablets for emergencies or eco-conscious travel.

Q: What about natural disasters?
A: Sri Lanka occasionally experiences monsoon flooding in certain areas. Landslides can occur in hill country during heavy rains. The 2004 tsunami risk led to warning systems now in place. Cyclones are rare but possible. Monitor weather during monsoon seasons. Hotels and authorities will advise if conditions are dangerous. Travel insurance should cover natural disasters. Generally, risks are low and shouldn't deter travel.

Q: How do I stay safe on the roads?
A: Sri Lankan roads can be challenging with different driving styles. When using tuk-tuks or taxis, ensure drivers aren't under influence. Wear seatbelts where available. Avoid traveling on roads after dark when possible. If self-driving, be extra cautious - roads are narrow, overtaking is common, and unexpected obstacles appear. Buses drive fast so give them space. Animals on roads are common in rural areas.

Q: What if I lose my passport?
A: Contact your embassy/consulate immediately - most are in Colombo. They can issue emergency travel documents. File a police report for the lost passport. Keep photocopies of your passport separately and consider having digital copies. Some embassies require appointments so call first. The process is easier if you have passport copies and extra photos. Hotels can often assist with embassy contacts.

Q: Are there areas to avoid in Sri Lanka?
A: Sri Lanka is generally safe throughout. The north and east are now fully accessible after past conflicts. Exercise normal caution in any crowded areas. Avoid isolated beaches at night. Some areas near military installations prohibit photography. During full moon (Poya) days, alcohol isn't sold and some activities close. Always check current advice from your embassy but most tourist areas have no restrictions.

Q: What about travel insurance?
A: Strongly recommended. Ensure coverage includes medical evacuation, adventure activities if planned (diving, surfing), and trip cancellation. Check if motorbike riding is covered if you plan to rent. Many policies exclude coverage if riding without proper license. Hospital care for serious issues may require upfront payment - insurance reimburses later. Keep all receipts. Some credit cards provide basic travel insurance.

Q: Can I rent and ride a motorbike/scooter?
A: Technically you need an international driving permit plus temporary local permit. Many places rent without checking but you're uninsured if unlicensed. Police checkpoints fine unlicensed riders. More concerning is safety - Sri Lankan traffic is challenging for inexperienced riders. Many tourist injuries involve motorbike accidents. If you do ride, always wear a helmet, avoid night riding, and check brakes before renting. Consider if the risk is worth it.

Q: How do I respect local customs?
A: Remove shoes before entering homes and temples. Dress modestly at religious sites - cover shoulders and knees. Don't point feet at Buddha statues or people. Public displays of affection are frowned upon. The head is considered sacred - don't touch locals' heads. Give and receive items with right hand or both hands. Be patient - things move at "Sri Lankan time." A smile goes a long way in interactions.

Q: What if I need police help?
A: Tourist Police (1912) have English speakers and handle tourist-related issues. Regular police (119) may have limited English. For reports (theft, accidents), go to nearest police station - procedures can be slow so allow time. Keep copies of reports for insurance. Your hotel or driver can assist with police interactions. Police are generally helpful but bureaucracy can be frustrating. Remain calm and patient.
