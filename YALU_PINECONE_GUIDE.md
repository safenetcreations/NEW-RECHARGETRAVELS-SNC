# üß† Yalu's Brain: Pinecone Knowledge Base Guide

## What is Pinecone?

Pinecone is a **vector database** that gives Yalu long-term memory and deep knowledge about Sri Lanka. Think of it as Yalu's brain where all travel information is stored and can be instantly retrieved.

## How It Works

### 1. **Knowledge Storage**
```
Text about beaches ‚Üí AI converts to numbers (vectors) ‚Üí Stored in Pinecone
```

### 2. **Smart Retrieval**
```
User asks question ‚Üí Convert to vector ‚Üí Find similar vectors ‚Üí Return relevant info
```

### 3. **Semantic Understanding**
- Understands meaning, not just keywords
- "Best beaches" finds info about Mirissa, Unawatuna, etc.
- "Where to see elephants" finds wildlife park information

## What Knowledge We Store

### üìö Structured Knowledge (Hand-crafted)
- **Beaches**: Complete guide to all beach areas
- **Wildlife**: Detailed park information, safari tips
- **Culture**: Temple etiquette, heritage sites
- **Food**: Restaurant recommendations, must-try dishes
- **Practical**: Visa, transport, money, safety

### üåê Scraped Knowledge (Automated)
- Official tourism websites
- Travel blogs and guides
- Current events and updates
- Real-time information

## Building Yalu's Knowledge

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run this command to fill Yalu's brain with knowledge
./scripts/build-yalu-knowledge.sh
```

### What Happens
1. **Processes** all structured guides about Sri Lanka
2. **Scrapes** travel websites for current info
3. **Creates embeddings** (converts text to vectors)
4. **Stores** in Pinecone for instant access

### Time Required
- First run: ~10-15 minutes
- Updates: ~5 minutes
- Runs automatically: Daily at 2 AM

## How Yalu Uses This Knowledge

### Example Flow
1. **User**: "What's the best beach for surfing?"
2. **Yalu**: 
   - Converts question to vector
   - Searches Pinecone for similar content
   - Finds: Arugam Bay (expert), Weligama (beginner)
   - Responds with specific, accurate information
