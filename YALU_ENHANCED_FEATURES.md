## 🎤 Setting Up Custom Voice in ElevenLabs

1. **Go to ElevenLabs Voice Lab**: https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab
2. **Create your custom voice**:
   - Upload voice samples (3-5 minutes ideal)
   - Name it (e.g., "Yalu Sri Lankan")
   - Add description
3. **Get the Voice ID**:
   - Go to Voices section
   - Click on your voice
   - Copy the Voice ID
4. **Update the code**:
   ```typescript
   // In EnhancedYaluVoiceAgent.tsx, line 165
   // Replace 'pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB' with your custom voice ID
   const response = await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/YOUR_VOICE_ID_HERE', {
   ```

## 🧠 Building Knowledge Base

Run this command to populate Yalu's knowledge:

```bash
cd /Users/nanthan/Desktop/Recharge\ by\ Claude-21-07-25/rechargetravels-sri-lankashalli-create-in-github
npx ts-node scripts/build-knowledge-base.ts
```

This will:
- Scrape Sri Lankan travel websites
- Create embeddings using OpenAI
- Store in Pinecone for semantic search
- Enable Yalu to answer with real, updated information

## 🌐 Adding More Languages

To add a new language:

1. Update `LANGUAGES` object in `EnhancedYaluVoiceAgent.tsx`:
```typescript
const LANGUAGES = {
  // ... existing languages
  hi: { name: 'हिन्दी', flag: '🇮🇳', greeting: 'नमस्ते' },
}
```

2. The system will automatically:
   - Show in language selector
   - Adapt voice recognition
   - Respond in that language

## 📚 Adding Custom Knowledge

Add your own knowledge sources:

1. **Static Knowledge**: Edit `STATIC_KNOWLEDGE` in `build-knowledge-base.ts`
2. **Website Sources**: Add URLs to `KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES`
3. **Run the builder** to update Pinecone

Example:
```typescript
{
  url: 'https://your-travel-blog.com/sri-lanka',
  category: 'blog-insights'
}
```
