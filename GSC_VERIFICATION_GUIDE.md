## ☑️ VERIFICATION METHOD 1: HTML Meta Tag (RECOMMENDED)

This is the easiest method since we can add it directly to your index.html.

### Steps:

1. **In Google Search Console**, when you see the verification screen:
   - Click on **"HTML tag"** tab
   - Copy the meta tag that looks like:
     ```html
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />
     ```

2. **I will add this to your index.html** - Just paste the meta tag here and I'll deploy it for you.

3. **Click "Verify"** in Google Search Console

## ☑️ VERIFICATION METHOD 2: Google Analytics (If Already Set Up)

If you already have Google Analytics connected:
1. Select "Google Analytics" method
2. Click "Verify"

---

## ☑️ VERIFICATION METHOD 3: HTML File Upload

If you downloaded the verification file:

1. **Check your Downloads folder** for a file named like:
   - `google[RANDOM_STRING].html`
   
2. **Tell me the exact filename** and I'll:
   - Copy it to the project
   - Deploy it
   - You can then click "Verify"

## 📋 AFTER VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE:

### 1. Submit Sitemap

Once verified, I'll help you:
- Go to "Sitemaps" section
- Submit: `sitemap.xml`

### 2. Request Indexing

- Go to URL Inspection tool
- Enter: `https://recharge-travels-73e76.web.app/`
- Click "Request Indexing"

## 🔍 Current Status:

**Next Step:** Please either:
1. Copy the **HTML meta tag** from Google Search Console and paste it here
2. Or tell me the **exact filename** of the verification file in your Downloads folder
3. Or if you have **Google Analytics**, just click "Verify" in that tab

I'll handle the rest!
